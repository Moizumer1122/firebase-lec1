✅ REAL USAGE OF JS CONCEPTS IN CRUD PROJECTS:
🔢 #	Concept	How it's used in CRUD apps
1	Variables	Store user input, IDs, messages, etc.
2	Functions	Define actions like handleSubmit(), editUser()
3	Arrow Functions	Short syntax for handlers, e.g. onClick={() => ...}
4	Arrays	Store lists like users, products, appointments
5	Objects	Store single items like one product or one user
6	Loops	Show data manually (less common than .map)
7	map()	Show lists in UI (appointments.map(...))
8	if / else	Conditional display (e.g., show "No data" if empty)
9	Events	Handle clicks, form submissions, edits, deletes
10	useState	Store form values, user data, loading states
11	useEffect	Fetch data when page loads (GET /api/users)
12	JSX	Display HTML + JS together, like showing user names
13	Destructuring	Extract data from props or objects
14	Spread Operator	Update objects without changing original
15	Ternary Operator (THERE ARE 15 POINTS YOU DISCUSS WITH ME )
